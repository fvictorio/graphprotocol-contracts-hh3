# ðŸŒ… Graph Horizon ðŸŒ…

Graph Horizon is the next evolution of the Graph Protocol.

## Deployment 

We use Hardhat Ignition to deploy the contracts. To build and deploy Graph Horizon run the following commands:

```bash
yarn install
yarn build
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/horizon.ts \
  --parameters ./ignition/configs/horizon.hardhat.json5 \
  --network hardhat
```

You can use any network defined in `hardhat.config.ts` by replacing `hardhat` with the network name.

Note that this will deploy a standalone version of Graph Horizon contracts, meaning the Subgraph Service will not be deployed. If you want to deploy both please refer to the [Subgraph Service README](../subgraph-service/README.md) for deploy instructions.
