[The Graph](https://thegraph.com/) is an indexing protocol for querying networks like Ethereum, IPFS, Polygon, and other blockchains. Anyone can build and Publish open APIs, called subgraphs, making data easily accessible.

## Packages

This repository is a Yarn workspaces monorepo containing the following packages:

| Package | Latest version | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [contracts](./packages/contracts) | [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/@graphprotocol%2Fcontracts.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/@graphprotocol%2Fcontracts) | Contracts enabling the open and permissionless decentralized network known as The Graph protocol. |
| [sdk](./packages/sdk) | [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/@graphprotocol%2Fsdk.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/@graphprotocol%2Fsdk) | TypeScript based SDK to interact with the protocol contracts |


## Development

### Setup
To set up this project you'll need [git](https://git-scm.com) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed. Note that Yarn v4 is required to install the dependencies and build the project. 

From your command line:

```bash
# Enable Yarn v4
corepack enable
yarn set version stable

# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/graphprotocol/contracts

# Go into the repository
$ cd contracts

# Install dependencies
$ yarn

# Build projects
$ yarn build
```

### Versioning a package 

To version a package, run the following command from the root of the repository:

```bash
# Change directory to the package you want to version
$ cd packages/<package-name>

# Bump the version
$ yarn version <major|minor|patch>
```

__Note on cross referenced packages__: Bumping the version of a package that is cross referenced by another package will automatically bump the dependency version in the other package. For example, if you bump the version of `sdk` from `0.0.1` to `0.0.2`, the required version of `sdk` in the `contracts` package will automatically be bumped to `0.0.2`. Depending on the nature of the change you might need to bump (and publish) a new version of the `contracts` package as well.

### Publishing a package

Packages are published and distributed via NPM. To publish a package, run the following command from the root of the repository:

```bash
# Publish the package
$ yarn npm publish --access public --tag <tag>
```

Alternatively, there is a GitHub action that can be manually triggered to publish a package.

## Documentation

> Coming soon

For now, each package has its own README with more specific documentation you can check out.
